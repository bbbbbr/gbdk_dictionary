A simple dictionary word validator for use with GBDK / ZGB / GBStudio which supports ROM banking.

At present it's a quick and simple implementation with support for words 3-6 letters long. 
While not nearly as fast and size efficient as the [GB-wordyl](https://github.com/bbbbbr/gb-wordyl) 
dictionary, it's far less complicated and should be easier to understand, modify and use in other projects.
